## Introduction to PoC, Prototype, and MVP Stages

A proof of concept (PoC), prototype, and minimum viable product (MVP) are essential stages in the software development process, enabling organizations to reduce risk, optimize resources, and increase the likelihood of success. By understanding the purpose and objectives of each stage, we can create a streamlined and efficient development process that meets our goals and delivers valuable solutions to users.

### 1. Proof of Concept (PoC)

The PoC stage aims to validate the feasibility of an idea or solution. It provides an opportunity to explore the technical and functional aspects of a project before committing significant resources. The primary goal of a PoC is to demonstrate that the core concept is viable and has the potential for further development. PoCs help identify potential roadblocks, assess technical risks, and refine the project's scope, providing a solid foundation for moving forward.

### 2. Prototype

Once the PoC stage validates the project's core idea, the prototype stage focuses on building a working model that showcases the solution's features and functionality. Prototyping helps refine the user experience, uncover potential usability issues, and gather feedback from users and stakeholders. This stage emphasizes the iterative process of design and development, enabling the team to incorporate feedback, make improvements, and optimize the overall solution.

### 3. Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

After the prototype stage, the project advances to the MVP stage, where a fully-functional version of the product is developed and launched. The MVP serves as the first release, containing only the essential features necessary to satisfy early adopters and validate the product's market fit. The MVP stage allows organizations to test their solution in the market, gather real-world user feedback, and iterate based on insights gained from actual usage.

## MPC Wallet Building Example

### PoC: Research and Validate MPC Wallet Implementation

   - Conduct research on Web3Auth's MPC offering and its potential for our use case
   - Identify key technical components and requirements
   - Assess potential risks and roadblocks
   - Evaluate the compatibility with our existing systems
   - Develop a high-level architecture diagram to visualize the proposed solution
   - Present findings and recommendations to stakeholders

### Prototype: Develop a Working Demo of the MPC Wallet

   - Design the user experience and interface for the MPC wallet
   - Implement key features, such as wallet creation, transfers, and dApp connections
   - Develop the technical architecture based on the PoC findings
   - Test and validate the prototype to ensure it meets the desired functionality and security
   - Gather feedback from users and stakeholders to iterate on the design and functionality

### MVP: Launch a Fully-functional MPC Wallet

   - Refine the prototype based on feedback and additional requirements
   - Implement any remaining features and functionality
   - Perform rigorous testing and quality assurance to ensure a secure and reliable product
   - Develop a deployment plan and rollout strategy
   - Launch the MVP to early adopters and monitor its performance in the market
